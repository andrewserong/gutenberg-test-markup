# Gutenberg test markup

This repo contains some hard-coded markup that can be used to test various features of the WordPress block editor (Gutenberg). While working on features in the Gutenberg repository (https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg) it can be useful to manually test features with existing block markup. However, it can be challenging sometimes to think of all the different permutations of settings that might be present, or already in use in live sites.

While this repo isn't exhaustive for all settings and features, it seeks to store quite a few permutations to hopefully help catch edge cases, or at least inspire testing a wide range of values while implementing new features or changes to existing features.

The markup here doesn't seek to exhaustively cover deprecated markup.

This repo is in no way official, but is just a simple home to store some markup I personally find useful in testing. Feel free to fork or use as you see fit!
